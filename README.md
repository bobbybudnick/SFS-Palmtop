design notes
-----
A pi 3 would be an obvious better fit here but I used what I had.  Using a 4 inch SPI screen instead would free up the HDMI port which would be useful if this were used as a primary device or it could be used as a mobile video, audio, web or presentation device.  You can tie the amplifier power directly into the output board or splice into a cable to avoid the unsightly USB connector being plugged in.
