# SFS-Palmtop

hardware
-----
4 inch screen in landscape mode

very basic mounting tape hinge  
wide and thin bluetooth keyboard  
3d printed extension to house amplifier/power supply/battery with hole for speaker  
3d printed foot that allows the device to tilt back like a laptop

design notes
-----
A pi 3 would be an obvious better fit here but I used what I had.  Using a 4 inch SPI screen instead would free up the HDMI port which would be useful if this were used as a primary device or it could be used as a mobile video, audio, web or presentation device.
